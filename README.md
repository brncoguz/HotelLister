# Graduate iOS Developer Interview Assignment

## Purpose

This exercise is your opportunity to show us your technical craftsmanship and creativity.

It will also be used as a basis for discussion in any subsequent interviews.


## Objective

This _HotelLister_ iPhone project includes a data file [hotels.json](HotelLister/hotels.json), which contains details of some sample hotels.

Your app must load this file and display the results in a table view, according to these requirements:

1. For each hotel, you must display at least the **hotel name**, the **full address** and the **star rating**.
2. You should filter the loaded hotels to display only those with a **review score of 8 or above**.
3. Hotels should be **grouped by city** into table sections, and **sorted by review score** within each section (highest scores first).


##ï¿¼ Guidelines

- You may use Objective C or Swift to implement your solution;
- You may not use a web view to display UI;
- You may use provided template or create a separate project;
- Before submission, make sure that your project builds, runs without crashes and doesn't contain dead or commented code. 

There are no other restrictions on how you implement your solution.

Any features you implement in addition to the requirements are a bonus, but _you should not spend more than a few hours_ in total on this assignment.

Simplicity, readability and creativity are valued higher than extra complicated features.
